For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

At study entry and 1 yr later, fasting blood samples were obtained for measurement of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, retinol, and beta-carotene. Retinol concentrations changed minimally in both groups; beta-carotene concentration increased an average of 12.1 + or - 47 nmol/L in the placebo group and 4279 + or - 657 nmol/l in the active treatment group. Both groups experienced similar small increases in triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations and small decreases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Daily oral administration of 50 mg beta-carotene/day did not affect plasma lipid concentrations.",

The Committee was unable to establish a group ADI for synthetic Î²carotene, Î²-carotene derived from B. trispora, Î²-carotene-rich extract from D. salina, and Î²-apo-8â²-carotenoic acid methyl and ethyl esters because a group ADI is applicable to the general population, which includes heavy smokers. The Committee noted that it is very unlikely that it will ever be possible to establish a group ADI because further data from the population of heavy smokers cannot be gathered ethically."

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

An enzyme, beta-carotenoid-15,15'-dioxygenase, has been partly purified from the intestines of several species and has been identified in several other organs and species. The enzyme, which converts beta-carotene into two molecules of retinal in good yield, requires molecular oxygen and is inhibited by sulfhydryl binding reagents and iron binding reagents. Most provitamin A carotenoids, including the beta-apo-carotenals, are cleaved to retinal by this enzyme. Its maximal activity in the rabbit is approximately 200 times that required to meet nutritional needs but is less than 50% of that expected to produce signs of vitamin A toxicity. Excentric cleavage unquestionably occurs in plants and some microorganisms and might occur in mammals. Thus far, however, carotenoid dioxygenase with excentric bond specificity has been identified in mammals, the yield of beta-apo-carotenals from beta-carotene in vivo and in vitro is very low, and beta-apo-carotenals are formed nonbiologically from beta-carotene.",

The drug has no effect on the basic biochemical abnormality of erythropoietic protoporphyria (eg, erythrocyte, plasma, and stool concentrations of protoporphyrins are not altered by the drug). The precise mechanism by which the drug exerts photoprotection has not been established. There is some evidence that photosensitizers may act through the formation of singlet excited oxygen and/or free radicals. Since in vitro studies indicate that beta carotene can quench free radicals and singlet excited oxygen, this may be the mechanism by which the drug acts. It is unlikely that beta carotene acts simply as a filter for the wavelengths of light that induce phototoxic effects.",

Maternal vitamin A requirements are increased during lactation, but there are no specific guidelines for increased beta-carotene intake or indications for high-dose supplementation in nursing mothers. Typical beta-carotene intake in a Western diet is 6 to 8 mg daily. Beta-carotene is a normal component of human colostrum and mature milk, where it contributes to antioxidant defenses in the neonate. A systematic review found that in infants younger than 6 months, those fed primarily human milk have greater blood carotenoid concentrations than those fed formula. Some evidence suggests that there is a correlation between beta-carotene and infant motor development in exclusively breastfed infants, but not in overall psychomotor performance. Beta-carotene supplementation during pregnancy and for 6 months postpartum in nursing mothers with poor diets in a resource-poor setting reduced the number of days of illness in the mothers, but does not reduce infant morbidity or mortality according to another study. The bioavailability of beta-carotene is dependent on the fat content of the meal and the form in which it is administered, with synthetic pharmaceutical forms having the best bioavailability. High-dose beta-carotene supplements lead to a slow increase in breastmilk beta-carotene concentrations, with an accumulation half-life of about 9 days. Levels drop towards baseline slowly over several weeks after discontinuation. In general, beta-carotene is well tolerated, although excessive maternal intake of beta-carotene can lead to a harmless, reversible discoloration of the breastfed infant's skin. In HIV-infected women, high-dose beta-carotene plus vitamin A supplementation increases the rate of HIV viral shedding into breastmilk and increases HIV infection in breastfed infants, although the mortality rate over the first 2 years of life is not increased. The viral shedding may be a result of an increase in subclinical mastitis caused by beta-carotene. Beta-carotene concentration in breastmilk is not affected by refrigeration, freezing, or low-temperature microwaving. The concentration does decrease when milk passes through a tube feeding system, regardless of light exposure.",

Groups received either multivitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin B6, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folic acid), multivitamins plus vitamin A and beta-carotene, vitamin A and beta-carotene alone, or placebo daily. The beta-carotene dose was 30 mg. At 24 months of age, the multivitamin-supplemented group's infants had significantly better growth parameters than the other groups. One study found that the infants of mothers supplemented with vitamin A and beta-carotene had a higher rate of HIV transmission than those supplemented with multivitamins alone or placebo. After 6 months postpartum, women who received vitamin A plus beta-carotene had greater shedding of the HIV virus into breastmilk than women who had not; multivitamins without vitamin A and beta-carotene did not increase viral shedding. Beta-carotene appeared to have a shedding effect that was independent of vitamin A. One possible explanation comes from another similar study in which those who received vitamin A plus beta-carotene alone had a 45% increased risk of severe subclinical mastitis and those who received multivitamins plus vitamin A and beta-carotene had a 29% increased risk of severe subclinical mastitis.",

As expected, ethanol increased CYP2E1 (measured by Western blots) from 67 + or - 8 to 317 + or - 27 densitometric units (p < 0.001). Furthermore, beta-carotene potentiated the ethanol induction to 442 + or - 38 densitometric units (p < 0.01) with a significant interaction (p = 0.012). The rise was confirmed by a corresponding increase in the hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol, a specific substrate for CYP2E1, and by the inhibition with diethyl dithiocarbamate (50 microM). Beta-carotene alone also significantly induced CYP4A1 protein (328 + or - 49 vs. 158 + or - 17 densitometric units, p < 0.05). The corresponding CYP4A1 mRNA (measured by Northern blots) was also increased (p < 0.05) and there was a significant interaction of the two treatments (p = 0.015). The combination of ethanol and beta-carotene had no significant effect on either total cytochrome P-450 or CYP1A1/2, CYP2B, CYP3A, and CYP4A2/3 contents. Beta-carotene potentiates the CYP2E1 induction by ethanol in rat liver and also increases CYP4A1, which may, at least in part, explain the associated hepatotoxicity.",

One study of 29,000 males with a history of smoking found an 18% increase in the incidence of lung cancer in the group receiving 20 mg of beta-carotene a day for 5 to 8 years as compared with those receiving placebo . Another study of 18,000 individuals found 28% more lung cancers in individuals with a history of smoking and/or asbestos exposure who took 30 mg of beta-carotene in addition to 25,000 Units of retinol a day for 4 years as compared with those receiving placebo . However, one study of 22,000 male physicians, some of them smokers and former smokers, found no increased risk of lung cancer at doses of 50 mg of beta-carotene every other day for 12 years .",

We studied the effect of alpha-tocopherol (a form of vitamin E) and beta-carotene supplementation on urinary tract cancer in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. A total of 29,133 male smokers aged 50-69 years from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol (50 mg), beta-carotene (20 mg), both agents, or a placebo daily for 5-8 years (median 6.1 years). Incident urothelial cancers (bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis; n = 169) and renal cell cancers (n = 102) were identified through the nationwide cancer registry. The diagnoses were centrally confirmed by review of medical records and pathology specimens. The supplementation effects were estimated using a proportional hazards model. Neither alpha-tocopherol nor beta-carotene affected the incidence of urothelial cancer, relative risk 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.5) and 1.0 (95% CI 0.7-1.3), respectively, or the incidence of renal cell cancer, relative risk 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.6) and 0.8 95% CI 0.6-1.3), respectively. Long-term supplementation with alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene has no preventive effect on urinary tract cancers in middle-aged male smokers.",

Deaths from cardiovascular disease also increased (relative risk=1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.61)) in the group assigned to a combination of 30 mg beta-carotene and 25 000 IU retinyl palmitate (vitamin A) daily. The basis for increased cardiovascular mortality is unexplained. Data on serum lipids, available for 1474 CARET Vanguard participants who were enrolled in the two CARET pilot studies and transitioned to the Vanguard study /were analyzed/. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured 2 months prior to, 4 and 12 months following randomization, and annually thereafter for up to 7 y. In the asbestos-exposed pilot (N = 816), participants were assigned to beta-carotene and retinol or to placebo; in the smokers pilot (N = 1029), participants were assigned to beta-carotene, retinol, a combination, or placebo. Serum cholesterol showed a decline over time in both arms; serum triglycerides had a continuous decline over time in the placebo arm, but an initial increase that persisted in the active arm. Both serum cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.0003) and serum triglycerides (P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in the participants receiving vitamin A and/or a combination of vitamin A and beta-carotene (n = 863) as compared to the placebo group (n = 611). Those in this active intervention group had an average cholesterol concentration 5.3 mg/dl (0.137 mmol/l) higher than those in the placebo arm. /It was concluded/ the differences in cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations between the groups following randomization may account in part for the unexpected excess in cardiovascular deaths seen in the active intervention arm of CARET.",

This report updates results for beta-carotene and examines effect modification by baseline characteristics. Beta-carotene's effect on cancer over nearly 13 years was examined overall and within subgroups defined by baseline characteristics using proportional-hazards models. 2667 incident cancers were confirmed, with 1117 prostate, 267 colon, and 178 lung cancers. There were no significant differences with supplementation in total (relative risk (RR) = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9-1.0); prostate (RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.9-1.1); colon (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.2); or lung (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.2) cancer, and no differences over time. In subgroup analyses, total cancer was modestly reduced with supplementation among those aged 70+ years (RR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.7-1.0), daily drinkers of alcohol (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-1.0), and those in the highest BMI quartile (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.0). Prostate cancer was reduced with supplementation among those in the highest BMI quartile (RR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6-1.0), and colon cancer was reduced among daily drinkers of alcohol (RR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.8). The PHS found no overall effect of beta-carotene on total cancer, or the three most common site-specific cancers. The possibility of risk reduction within specific subgroups remains.",

Rats were divided into six groups. Initiation was performed in all animals by a single injection of diethylnitrosamine. During the selection/promotion period five doses of 2-acetylaminofluorene were administered to the rats and a partial hepatectomy was performed. To three different groups beta-carotene was given by gavage throughout the experiment, before the initiation or during the selection/promotion period respectively. Three other groups served as controls and received corn oil instead of the carotenoid. At the end of the study (8 weeks), beta- carotene administration throughout the experiment reduced the incidence (p< 0.005), multiplicity as well as the total number and size of hepatocyte nodules. Furthermore, it significantly decreased the number of foci per sq cm (p< 0.05), the average focal area (p< 0.01) and the percentage of liver parenchyma occupied (p< 0.01). Similar results were observed when beta-carotene was given only before the initiation. However, the administration of the carotenoid during the selection/promotion period did not result in significant decreases of these parameters. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of beta-carotene are primarily exerted on the initiation phase of the hepatocarcinogenic process. Nevertheless, continuous long term exposure to the carotenoid would confer a greater degree of protection. In addition, by means of an analysis of correlation a positive relationship was found between the number of hepatocyte nodules and the hepatic concentration of beta-carotene. In contrast, an inverse relationship was observed between the number of nodules and the hepatic concentration of total vitamin A.",

Myocardial infarction was induced in Wistar rats that were then treated with a BC diet (500 mg/kg of diet per day; MI-BC; n = 27) or a regular diet (MI; n = 27). Hearts were analyzed in vivo and in vitro after 6 mo. BC caused decreased left ventricular wall thickness (MI = 1.49 + or - 0.3 mm, MI-BC = 1.23 + or - 0.2 mm, P = 0.027) and increased diastolic (MI = 0.83 + or - 0.15 cm2, MI-BC = 0.98 + or - 0.14 cm2, P = 0.020) and systolic (MI = 0.56 + or - 0.12 cm2, MI-BC = 0.75 + or - 0.13 cm2, P = 0.002) left ventricular chamber areas. With respect to systolic function, the BC group presented less change in fractional area than did controls (MI = 32.35 + or - 6.67, MI-BC = 23.77 + or - 6.06, P = 0.004). There was no difference in transmitral diastolic flow velocities between groups. In vitro results showed decreased maximal isovolumetric systolic pressure (MI = 125.5 + or - 24.1 mm Hg, MI-BC = 95.2 + or - 28.4 mmHg, P = 0.019) and increased interstitial myocardial collagen concentration (MI = 3.3 + or - 1.2%, MI-BC = 5.8 + or - 1.7%, P = 0.004) in BC-treated animals. Infarct sizes were similar between groups (MI = 45.0 + or - 6.6%, MI-BC = 48.0 + or - 5.8%, P = 0.246). Taken together, these data suggest that BC has adverse effects on ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.",

Subjects (n = 21; aged 19-39 y) were randomly assigned to receive beta-carotene (30 mg/d) or placebo from days 4 to 32 postpartum. Each subject provided 8 diet records and 8 milk samples during the study. Diet records were analyzed for energy, macronutrients, vitamins A and E, and carotenoids. Milk samples were analyzed with HPLC for concentrations of carotenoids, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol. Data were analyzed by using repeated-measures analysis and orthogonal contrasts. No significant differences in average dietary intakes, body mass index, age, or parity were found between groups at baseline or after supplementation. Milk carotenoid concentrations decreased over time (P < 0.01), as did retinol and alpha-tocopherol concentrations (P < 0.003). Concentrations of most carotenoids decreased to those reported for mature milk by day 32 postpartum. Milk lutein concentrations remained elevated throughout the study compared with values reported for mature milk, whereas plasma lutein concentrations decreased significantly over time. beta-carotene supplementation did not significantly change the milk concentrations of beta-carotene, the other carotenoids, retinol, or alpha-tocopherol. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of increase in milk beta-carotene despite supplementation suggests that transitional milk may be already nearly saturated with beta-carotene. The elevated milk lutein concentration and simultaneous decrease in plasma lutein suggest that lutein metabolism may be altered during early lactation.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
