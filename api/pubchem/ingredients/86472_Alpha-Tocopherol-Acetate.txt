The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In all such cases, alpha-tocopherol is largely the preferred form of vitamin E to be administered.  Elsewhere, vitamin E's chemical profile as a fat-soluble antioxidant that is capable of neutralizing free radicals in the body continues to generate ongoing interest and study regarding how and whether or not the vitamin can help prevent or delay various chronic diseases associated with free radicals or other potential biological effects that vitamin E possesses like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, ocular conditions, immune illnesses, cancer, and more. None of these ongoing studies have yet to elucidate any formally significant evidence, however.",

It may also have anti-atherogenic, antithrombotic, anticoagulant, neuroprotective, antiviral, immunomodulatory, cell membrane-stabilizing and antiproliferative actions. Vitamin E is a collective term used to describe eight separate forms, the best-known form being alpha-tocopherol. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin and is an important antioxidant. It acts to protect cells against the effects of free radicals, which are potentially damaging by-products of the body's metabolism. Vitamin E is often used in skin creams and lotions because it is believed to play a role in encouraging skin healing and reducing scarring after injuries such as burns. There are three specific situations when a vitamin E deficiency is likely to occur. It is seen in persons who cannot absorb dietary fat, has been found in premature, very low birth weight infants (birth weights less than 1500 grams, or 3&frac12; pounds), and is seen in individuals with rare disorders of fat metabolism. A vitamin E deficiency is usually characterized by neurological problems due to poor nerve conduction. Symptoms may include infertility, neuromuscular impairment, menstrual problems, miscarriage and uterine degradation. Preliminary research has led to a widely held belief that vitamin E may help prevent or delay coronary heart disease. Antioxidants such as vitamin E help protect against the damaging effects of free radicals, which may contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer. It also protects other fat-soluble vitamins (A and B group vitamins) from destruction by oxygen. Low levels of vitamin E have been linked to increased incidence of breast and colon cancer.",

This is because the liver preferentially resecretes only alpha-tocopherol by way of the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP); the liver metabolizes and excretes all the other vitamin E variants, which is why blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol are ultimately lower.  Furthermore, the term alpha-tocopherol generally refers to a group of eight possible stereoisomers which is often called all-rac-tocopherol for being a racemic mixture of all eight stereoisomers. Of the eight stereoisomers, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol - or sometimes referred to as the d-alpha-tocopherol - stereoisomer is the naturally occurring form of alpha-tocopherol that is perhaps best recognized by the alpha-TTP and has been reported to demonstrate approximately twice the systemic availability of all-rac-tocopherol.  As a result, often times (but certainly not always) the discussion of vitamin E - at least within the context of using the vitamin for health-related indications - is generally in reference to the use of RRR- or d-alpha-tocopherol.",

                      "String": "When vitamin E is ingested, intestinal absorption plays a principal role in limiting its bioavailability. It is known that vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that follows the intestinal absorption, hepatic metabolism, and cellular uptake processes of other lipophilic molecules and lipids. The intestinal absorption of vitamin E consequently requires the presence of lipid-rich foods.  In particular, stable alpha-tocopherol acetate undergoes hydrolysis by bile acid-dependant lipase in the pancreas or by an intestinal mucosal esterase. Subsequent absorption in the duodenum occurs by way of transfer from emulsion fat globules to water-soluble multi- and unilamellar vesicles and mixed micelles made up of phospholipids and bile acids. As the uptake of vitamin E into enterocytes is less efficient compared to other types of lipids, this could potentially explain the relatively low bioavailability of vitamin E.  Alpha-tocopherol acetate itself is embedded in matrices where its hydrolysis and its uptake by intestinal cells are markedly less efficient than in mixed micelles. Subsequently, the intestinal cellular uptake of vitamin E from mixed micelles follows in principle two different pathways across enterocytes: (a) via passive diffusion, and (b) via receptor-mediated transport with various cellular transports like scavenger receptor class B type 1, Niemann-Pick C1-like protein, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5/ABCG8, or ABCA1, among others.  Vitamin E absorption from the intestinal lumen is dependent upon biliary and pancreatic secretions, micelle formation, uptake into enterocytes, and chylomicron secretion. Defects at any step can lead to impaired absorption.. Chylomicron secretion is required for vitamin E absorption and is a particularly important factor for efficient absorption. All of the various vitamin E forms show similar apparent efficiencies of intestinal absorption and subsequent secretion in chylomicrons. During chylomicron catabolism, some vitamin E is distributed to all the circulating lipoproteins.  Chylomicron remnants, containing newly absorbed vitamin E, are then taken up by the liver. Vitamin E is secreted from the liver in very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Plasma vitamin E concentrations depend upon the secretion of vitamin E from the liver, and only one form of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, is ever preferentially resecreted by the liver. The liver is consequently responsible for discriminating between tocopherols and the preferential plasma enrichment with alpha-tocopherol. In the liver, the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) likely is in charge of the discriminatory function, where RRR- or d-alpha-tocopherol possesses the greatest affinity for alpha-TTP.  It is nevertheless believed that only a small amount of administered vitamin E is actually absorbed. In two individuals with gastric carcinoma and lymphatic leukemia, the respective fractional absorption in the lymphatics was only 21 and 29 percent of label from meals containing alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl acetate, respectively.  Additionally, after feeding three separate single doses of 125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg to a group of healthy males, the observed plasma peak concentrations (ng/mL) were 1822 +/- 48.24, 1931.00 +/- 92.54, and 2188 +/- 147.61, respectively.",

Next, peroxisome ω-oxidation results in 13’-carboxychromanol (13’-COOH). Following these two steps are five consecutive β-oxidation reactions which serve to shorten the alpha-tocopherol metabolite side-chains. The first of these β-oxidations occurs still in the peroxisome environment, generating carboxydimethyldecylhydroxychromanol (CDMDHC, 11’-COOH). Then, in the mitochondrion, the second β-oxidation step forms the carboxymethyloctylhydroxychromanol (CDMOHC, 9’-COOH) metabolite. Since both CDMDHC and CDMOHC possess a side-chain length of between 13 to 9 carbon units, they are considered long-chain metabolites. The hydrophobicity of these long-chain metabolites means they are not excreted in the urine but have been found in human microsomes, serum, and feces. The next two β-oxidation reactions, still within the mitochondrion environment, produce two intermediate chain metabolites: carboxymethylhexylhydroxychromanol (CDMHHC, 7’-COOH), followed by carboxymethylbutylhydroxychromanol (CMBHC, 5’-COOH). Both of these intermediate chain metabolites are found in human plasma, feces, and urine. Finally, the last mitochrondrion β-oxidation generates the catabolic end product of alpha-tocopherol metabolism: carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans (CEHC, 3'-COOH), which is considered a short-chain metabolite. CEHC has been observed in human plasma, serum, urine, and feces.",

It also appears to reduce oxLDL-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Oxidation of LDL is a key early step in atherogenesis as it triggers a number of events which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) activity. PKC plays a role in smooth muscle cell proliferation, and, thus, the inhibition of PKC results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is involved in atherogenesis. <br/>Vitamin E's antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities involves the downregulation of the expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule(ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM)-1 which lowers the adhesion of blood components to the endothelium. In addition, vitamin E upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 which in turn enhances the release of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a vasodilating factor and inhibitor of platelet aggregation and platelet release. It is also known that platelet aggregation is mediated by a mechanism involving the binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complex of platelets. GPIIb/IIIa is the major membrane receptor protein that is key to the role of the platelet aggregation response. GPIIb is the alpha-subunit of this platelet membrane protein. Alpha-tocopherol downregulates GPIIb promoter activity which results in reduction of GPIIb protein expression and decreased platelet aggregation. Vitamin E has also been found in culture to decrease plasma production of thrombin, a protein which binds to platelets and induces aggregation. A metabolite of vitamin E called vitamin E quinone or alpha-tocopheryl quinone (TQ) is a potent anticoagulant. This metabolite inhibits vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which is a major enzyme in the coagulation cascade.<br/>The neuroprotective effects of vitamin E are explained by its antioxidant effects. Many disorders of the nervous system are caused by oxidative stress. Vitamin E protects against this stress, thereby protecting the nervouse system. <br/>The immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin E have been demonstrated in vitro, where alpha-tocopherol increases mitogenic response of T lymphocytes from aged mice. The mechanism of this response by vitamin E is not well understood, however it has been suggested that vitamin E itself may have mitogenic activity independent of its antioxidant activity. <br/>Lastly, the mechanism of action of vitamin E's antiviral effects (primarily against HIV-1) involves its antioxidant activity. Vitamin E reduces oxidative stress, which is thought to contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, as well as to the pathogenesis of other viral infections. Vitamin E also affects membrane integrity and fluidity and, since HIV-1 is a membraned virus, altering membrane fluidity of HIV-1 may interfere with its ability to bind to cell-receptor sites, thus decreasing its infectivity.",

                      "String": "Vitamin E's antioxidant capabilities are perhaps the primary biological action associated with alpha-tocopherol. In general, antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that consist of an unshared electron. These unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). In doing so, free radicals are capable of damaging cells, which may facilitate their contribution to the development of various diseases. Moreover, the human body naturally forms ROS when it converts food into energy and is also exposed to environmental free radicals contained in cigarette smoke, air pollution, or ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It is believed that perhaps vitamin E antioxidants might be able to protect body cells from the damaging effects of such frequent free radical and ROS exposure.  Specifically, vitamin E is a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation of free radical reactions. The vitamin E molecule is specifically a peroxyl radical scavenger and especially protects polyunsaturated fatty acids within endogenous cell membrane phospholipids and plasma lipoproteins. Peroxyl free radicals react with vitamin E a thousand times more rapidly than they do with the aforementioned polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, the phenolic hydroxyl group of tocopherol reacts with an organic peroxyl radical to form an organic hydroperoxide and tocopheroxyl radical. This tocopheroxyl radical can then undergo various possible reactions: it could (a) be reduced by other antioxidants to tocopherol, (b) react with another tocopheroxyl radical to form non-reactive products like tocopherol dimers, (c) undergo further oxidation to tocopheryl quinone, or (d) even act as a prooxidant and oxidize other lipids.  In addition to the antioxidant actions of vitamin E, there have been a number of studies that report various other specific molecular functions associated with vitamin E. For example, alpha-tocopherol is capable of inhibiting protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. In particular, protein kinase C inhibition by alpha-tocopherol is partially attributable to its attenuating effect on the generation of membrane-derived dialglycerol, a lipid that facilitates protein kinase C translocation, thereby increasing its activity.  In addition, vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium.  Vitamin E also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase-1. The increased expression of these two rate-limiting enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade explains the observation that vitamin E, in a dose-dependent fashion, enhanced the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans.  Furthermore, vitamin E can inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation, and platelet release reactions. The vitamin can also evidently inhibit the plasma generation of thrombin, a potent endogenous hormone that binds to platelet receptors and induces aggregation of platelets. Moreover, vitamin E may also be able to decrease monocyte adhesion to the endothellium by downregulating expression of adhesion molecules and decreasing monocyte superoxide production.  Given these proposed biological activities of vitamin E, the substance continues to generate ongoing interest and studies in whether or not vitamin E can assist in delaying or preventing various diseases with any one or more of its biologic actions. For instance, studies continue to see whether vitamin E's ability to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation can aid in preventing the development of cardiovascular disease or atherogenesis.  Similarly, it is also believed that if vitamin E can decrease the chance of cardiovascular disease then it can also decrease the chance of related diabetic disease and complications. In much the same way, it is also believed that perhaps the antioxidant abilities of vitamin E can neutralize free radicals that are constantly reacting and damaging cellular DNA. Furthermore, it is also believed that free radical damage does contribute to protein damage in the ocular lens - another free radical-mediated condition that may potentially be prevented by vitamin E use. Where it is also suggested that various central nervous system disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and Tardive Dyskinesia possess some form of oxidative stress component, it is also proposed that perhaps vitamin E use could assist with its antioxidant action.  There have also been studies that report the possibility of vitamin E supplementation can improve or reverse the natural decline in cellular immune function in healthy, elderly individuals.  As of this time however, there is either only insufficient data or even contradicting data (where certain doses of vitamin E supplementation could even potentially increase all-cause mortality) on which to suggest the use of vitamin E could formally benefit in any of these proposed indications.",
