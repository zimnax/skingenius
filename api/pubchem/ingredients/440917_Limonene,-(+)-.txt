This may protect salivary stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) from toxic aldehydes and prevent or improve radiation-induced xerostomia. Limonene and its metabolites perillic acid, dihydroperillic acid, uroterpenol and limonene 1,2-diol may also inhibit tumor growth through inhibition of p21-dependent signaling and may induce apoptosis via the induction of the transforming growth factor beta-signaling pathway. In addition, they inhibit post-translational modification of signal transduction proteins, resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest as well as differential expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

In rats, 5 mg/kg body weight of [(14)C]d-limonene applied dermally to the shaved back under occlusion, resulted in the absorption of approximately 12% of the dose. The absorbed d-limonene was completely metabolized and excreted rapidly, primarily from the urine (80%) with a small fraction (20%) excreted in the feces. There was no long-term retention of the test material in body tissues. In humans, following dermal application of 12 mg of [(14)C]d-limonene in ethanol (1 mL) to the back under nonocclusive conditions (for 1 h after application to allow the material to dry, thereafter under occlusion), only 0.16% of the dose was absorbed and the radioactivity was recovered from the urine. Radioactivity in human feces was below the limit of detection. These results indicate that under conditions of simulated use of fragrances and cosmetics, d-limonene has a low potential for dermal absorption and tissue accumulation, and the d-limonene that is absorbed is rapidly excreted in the urine. Based upon these findings and the knowledge that d-limonene possesses a low-systemic toxicity profile, it is reasonable to conclude that dermal exposure to d-limonene from fragrance and cosmetic applications is highly unlikely to result in any clinically significant human toxicity.",

The blood clearance of d-limonene observed in this study, 1.1 L/kg/hr, indicates that d-limonene is metabolized readily. About 1% of the total uptake was eliminated unchanged in the expired air after the end of exposure, while approximately 0.003% was eliminated in the urine. A long half-time in blood was observed in the slow elimination phase, which indicates accumulation in adipose tissues.",

Gel filtration HPLC indicated that d-limonene in male rat kidney is associated with a protein fraction having a mol wt of approximately 20000. Using reverse phase HPLC, d-limonene was shown to be associated with alpha-2u-globulin which was identified by amino acid sequencing. The major metabolite associated with alpha-2u-globulin was d-limonene-1,2-oxide. Parent d-limonene was also identified as a minor component in the alpha-2u-globulin fraction.",

The prerequisite step in the development of the nephropathy is the binding to alpha2u-globulin of an agent, which in the case of d-limonene is the 1,2-epoxide. This binding is specific for alpha2u-globulin and reversible, with a binding affinity (Kd) of approximately 5.6X10-7 mol/L. Binding of this ligand to alpha2u-globulin reduces the rate of its lysosomal degradation relative to that of native protein, thereby causing it to accumulate. Lysosomal cathepsin activity towards other protein substrates is not altered. Whereas accumulation of alpha2u-globulin can be observed after a single oral dose of d-limonene, continued treatment results in additional histological changes in the kidney. Phagolysosomes become enlarged, engorged with protein and show polyangular crystalloid inclusions. After 3-4 weeks of dosing, progressive renal injury, characterized by single-cell degeneration and necrosis in the P2 segment of the renal proximal tubule, is noted. Dead cells are sloughed into the lumen of the nephron, contributing to the development of granular casts at the cortico-medullary junction. Renal functional perturbations, including reduced uptake of organic anions, cations and amino acids and mild proteinuria resulting from a large increase in the amount of alpha2u-globulin excreted in urine, are observed. These functional changes occur only in male rats and only at doses that exacerbate the protein droplet formation. In response to the cell death and functional changes, there is a compensatory increase in cell proliferation in the kidney, most notably in the P2 segment of the proximal tubules, the site of protein accumulation. With continued treatment, the cell proliferation persists, but it does not restore renal function. The increase in cell proliferation is linked to the development of renal tubular tumors. alpha2u-Globulin nephropathy and renal-cell proliferation occur at doses consistent with those that produce renal tubular tumors.",

The involvement of hyaline droplet accumulation in the early nephrotoxicity associated with CIGA is a major difference from the sequence seen for classical carcinogens. The pathologic changes that precede the proliferative sequence for classical renal carcinogens also include a form of early nephrotoxicity, but no apparent hyaline droplet accumulation. Investigations performed in multiple laboratories ... have demonstrated a consistent association between hyaline droplets containing alpha2u-globulin and production of certain lesions in the male rat kidney. These renal lesions are not found in mice, female rats, or other laboratory species tested. The histopathological sequence in the male rat consists of the following: (1) an excessive accumulation of hyaline droplets containing alpha2u-globulin in renal proximal tubules; (2) subsequent cytotoxicity and single-cell necrosis of the tubule epithelium; (3) sustained regenerative tubule cell proliferation, providing exposure continues; (4) development of intralumenal granular casts from sloughed cell debris associated with tubule dilation, and papillary mineralization; (5) foci of tubule hyperplasia in the convoluted proximal tubules; and finally, (6) renal tubule tumors. Biochemical studies with model compounds show that CIGA or their metabolites bind specifically. but reversibly, to male rat alpha2u-globulin. The resulting alpha2u-globulin-CIGA complex appears to be more resistant to  hydrolytic degradation by lysosomal enzyemes than native, unbound alpha2u-globulin. Inhibition of the catabolism of alpha2u-globulin, a protein only slowly hydrolyzed by renal lysosomal enzymes under normal physiological conditions, provides a plausible basis for the initial stage of protein overload in the nephropathy sequence."

Wrap the empty container and put it in the trash after you have rinsed it."

[3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

D-Limonene, a major constituent of citrus oils, is a monoterpene widely used as a flavor/fragrance additive in cosmetics, foods, and industrial solvents as it possesses a pleasant lemon-like odor. It is registered for pesticide use in  the USA but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. D-Limonene is also used as gallstone solubilizer in animals and humans. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  Skin irritation or sensitizing potential was reported following widespread use of this agent in various consumer products. In humans, oxidation products or metabolites of d-limonene were shown to act as skin irritants. The potential occurrence of skin irritation necessitates regulation of this chemical as an ingredient in cosmetics. In humans, d-limonene has demonstrated low toxicity after single and repeated dosing for up to one year. D-Limonene was reported to significantly damage and increase permeability of membranes of human lung fibroblasts. ANIMAL STUDIES: In experimental animals oxidation products or metabolites of d-limonene were shown to act as skin irritants. D-Limonene has been designated as a chemical with low toxicity based upon lethal dose (LD50) and repeated-dose toxicity studies when administered orally to animals. Carcinogenic effects have also been observed in male rats, but the mode of action (MOA) is considered irrelevant for humans as the protein alpha(2u)-globulin responsible for this effect in rodents is absent in humans. d-Limonene induced hyaline droplet nephropathy in male rats. The liver was identified as a critical target organ following oral administration of d-limonene. D-Limonene (2363 mg/kg, orally) given to mice for 6 days from day 7-12 of gestation decreased body weight gain and increased incidence of abnormal bone formation in fetuses. D-Limonene also decreased body weight gain in male offspring; however, the toxicity of d-limonene was not severe. D-Limonene was not mutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, or TA 1537), did not significantly increase the number of trifluorothymidine-resistant cells in the mouse L5178Y/TK + or - assay, and did not induce chromosomal aberrations or sister chromatid exchanges in cultured CHO cells. All assays were conducted in the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation.",

Overall evaluation: In making its overall evaluation of the carcinogenicity to humans of d-limonene, the Working Group concluded that d-limonene produces renal tubular tumors in male rats by a non-DNA reactive alpha-2u-globulin associated response. Therefore, the mechanism by which d-limonene incr the incidence of renal tubular tumors in male rats is not relevant to humans. d-Limonene is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).",

In this study, we used D-limonene as a protective agent against the nephrotoxic effects of anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox). Rats were given D-limonene at doses of 5% and 10% mixed with diet for 20 consecutive days. Dox was given at the dose of 20 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally. The protective effects of D-limonene on Dox-induced oxidative stress and inflammation were investigated by assaying oxidative stress biomarkers, lipid peroxidation, serum toxicity markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Nitrite levels. Administration of Dox (20 mg/kg body weight) in rats enhanced renal lipid peroxidation; depleted glutathione content and anti-oxidant enzymes; elevated levels of kidney toxicity markers viz. kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine; enhanced expression of NFkB, COX-2, and iNOS and nitric oxide. Treatment with D-limonene prevented oxidative stress by restoring the levels of antioxidant enzymes, further both doses of 5% and 10% showed significant decrease in inflammatory response. Both the doses of D-limonene significantly decreased the levels of kidney toxicity markers KIM-1, BUN, and creatinine. D-limonene also effectively decreased the Dox induced overexpression of NF-kB, COX-2, and iNOS and nitric oxide. Data from the present study indicate the protective role of D-limonene against Dox-induced renal damage.",

Human prostate carcinoma DU-145 and normal prostate epithelial PZ-HPV-7 cells were treated with various concentrations of d -limonene, docetaxel or a combination of both, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and caspase activity were measured. Apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting, respectively. d-Limonene and docetaxel in combination significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity to DU-145 cells than PZ-HPV-7 cells. Exposure of DU-145 cells to a combined d-limonene and docetaxel resulted in higher ROS generation, depletion of GSH, accompanied by increased caspase activity than docetaxel alone. It also triggered a series of effects involving cytochrome c, cleavages of caspase-9, 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and a shift in Bad:Bcl-xL ratio in favor of apoptosis. Apoptotic effect was significantly blocked on pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, indicating that antitumor effect is initiated by ROS generation, and caspase cascades contribute to the cell death. Our results show ... that d-limonene enhanced the antitumor effect of docetaxel against prostate cancer cells without being toxic to normal prostate epithelial cells. The combined beneficial effect could be through the modulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. d-Limonene could be used as a potent non-toxic agent to improve the treatment outcome of hormone-refractory prostate cancer with docetaxel.",

Here we address the question whether the gaseous products or the ultrafine particles from the ozone-initiated chemistry of limonene, a common and abundant indoor pollutant, cause acute airway effects. The effects on the airways by d-limonene, a ca. 16s old ozone/d-limonene mixture, and clean air were evaluated by a mice bioassay, from which sensory irritation of the upper airways, airflow limitation, and pulmonary irritation can be obtained. A denuder was inserted to separate the ultrafine particles from the gaseous products prior to the exposure chamber. Reduction of mean respiratory frequency (>30%) and 230% increase of time of brake were observed without denuder, during 30 min exposure, to the ozonolyzed d-limonene mixture, which are indicative of prominent sensory effects. The initial concentrations (ppm) were 40 d-limonene and 4 ozone. The exposure concentrations (ppm) were about 35 d-limonene and 0.05 ozone. Formaldehyde and residual d-limonene, the salient sensory irritants, accounted for up to three-fourth of the sensory irritation. The upper airway effects reversed to baseline upon cessation of exposure. An effect on the conducting airways was also significant, which did not reverse completely upon cessation. Airway effects were absent with the denuder inserted, which did not alter the size distribution of ultrafine particles (approximately 10 mg/cu m), significantly. The result was statistically indistinguishable from clean dry air. It is concluded that ultrafine particles that are generated from ozone-initiated d-limonene chemistry and denuded are not causative of sensory effects in the airways.",

The dose levels used were based on the results of a range finding study with the individual compounds in the same strain of rats kept under similar experimental conditions, and comprised the 'Minimum Nephrotoxic Effect Level' and the 'No Nephrotoxic Effect Level' of each of the four compunds alone and in combination. A group of vehicle treated rats served as controls. At the 'Minimum Nephrotoxic Effect Level' of the combinations, antagonism of effects was encountered, seen for example as less severely increased activity of gamma-glutamyl transferase in the urine. Synergism of effects was also observed, for example increased severity of renal tubular necrosis, and more markedly increased activity of urinary lysozyme, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. More importantly, however, at the 'No Nephrotoxic Effect Level' of the combination no signs of impaired renal function or renal damage were observed, suggesting absence of both dose additivity and potentiating interaction at the tested subeffective levels of the individual nephrotoxicants.",

It is oxidized by ozone to secondary organic aerosols consisting of aldehydes, acids, oxidants and fine and ultra fine particles. The lung irritant effects of these limonene ozone reaction products (LOP) were investigated. Female F344 rats (2- and 18-month-old) were exposed for 3 hr to air or LOP formed by reacting 6 ppm d-limonene and 0.8 ppm ozone. BAL fluid, lung tissue and cells were analyzed 0 hr and 20 hr later. Inhalation of LOP increased TNF-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, and superoxide dismutase in alveolar macrophages (AM) and Type II cells. Responses of older animals were attenuated when compared to younger animals. LOP also decreased p38 MAP kinase in AM from both younger and older animals. In contrast, while LOP increased p44/42 MAP kinase in AM from younger rats, expression decreased in AM and Type II cells from older animals. NF-kappaB and C/EBP activity also increased in AM from younger animals following LOP exposure but decreased or was unaffected in Type II cells. Whereas in younger animals LOP caused endothelial cell hypertrophy, perivascular and pleural edema and thickening of alveolar septal walls, in lungs from older animals, patchy accumulation of fluid within septal walls in alveolar sacs and subtle pleural edema were noted. LOP are pulmonary irritants inducing distinct inflammatory responses in younger and older animals. This may contribute to the differential sensitivity of these populations to pulmonary irritants.",

A dose response relationship for acute exacerbation of hyaline droplets by d-limonene treatment was observed. Hyaline droplets were graded according to size, eosinophilic intensity, and the number of tubules loaded with droplets. Control rats received a mean score of 3. At 3 mmol/kg, admin of d-limonene resulted in a score of 10. At 0.1 mmol/kg, no effect on hyaline droplet accumulation was seen in male rats. 24 hr after admin of 3 mmol d-limonene/kg, the renal concentration of d-limonene equivalents was approximately 2.5 times higher in male rats than in female rats. Equilibrium dialysis in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that approximately 40% of the d-limonene equivalents in male rat kidney associated with proteins in a reversible manner, whereas no significant association was observed between d-limonene equivalents and female rat kidney proteins. Gel filtration HPLC indicated that d-limonene in male rat kidney is associated with a protein fraction having a mol wt of approximately 20,000. Using reverse phase HPLC, d-limonene was shown to be associated with alpha-2u-globulin which was identified by amino acid sequencing. The major metabolite associated with alpha-2u-globulin was d-limonene-1,2-oxide. Parent d-limonene was also identified as a minor component in the alpha-2u-globulin fraction.",

Male NCI Black Reiter rats were administered various cmpd including 1650 mg/kg d-limonene by gavage daily for 4 days. Twenty four hours after the last dose, the animals were killed and the kidneys were removed and sectioned. Nephrotoxicity was assessed by examining the sections for the presence of hyaline droplets and other histological changes. The sections were assayed for alpha-2u-globulin using a histochemical technique. Lindane induced hyaline droplet formation in male, but not female, F344 rats. d-Limonene did not induce hyaline droplet formation or alpha-2u-globulin production in male NCI Black Reiter rats. It was concluded that the presence of alpha-2u-globulin is necessary for the development of kidney disease in male rats exposed to d-limonene.",

Mean body weights of rats dosed with d-limonene were similar to those of vehicle controls throughout the studies. Survival of the high dose female rats after week 39 and of the vehicle control male rats after week 81 was significantly reduced (survival at week 104--male: vehicle control, 29/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 40/50; female: 42/50; 40/50; 26/50). The kidney was confirmed as the primary target organ for chemically related lesions. No lesions were observed in female rats. For males, the nonneoplastic lesions included exacerbation of the age-related nephropathy, linear deposits of mineral in the renal medulla and papilla, and focal hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium overlying the renal papilla. Uncommon tubular cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the kidney also occurred in dosed male rats, and this effect was supported by a dose-related increased incidence of tubular cell hyperplasia. ... There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of d-limonene for male F344/N rats, as shown by increased incidences of tubular cell hyperplasia, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas of the kidney. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of d-limonene for female F344/N rats that received 300 or 600 mg/kg.",

Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control male mice were similar throughout the studies. Mean body weights of high dose female mice were notably lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 28. Survival of the low dose group-of male mice was significantly lower than that of vehicle controls at the end of the study (33/50; 24/50; 39/50). No difference in survival was observed between vehicle control and dosed female mice (43/50; 44/50; 43/50). ... No chemically related increases in neoplasms were observed. The incidence of neoplasms of the anterior pituitary gland in high dose female mice was lower than that in vehicle controls (adenomas or carcinomas, combined: vehicle control, 12/49; high dose, 2/48). Cells with an abnormal number of nuclei (8/49; 32/50) and cytomegaly (23/49; 38/50) were observed in the liver of high dose male mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of d-limonene for male B6C3Fl mice that received 250 or 500 mg/kg.

Its use as an insecticide, insect repellant and animal (dog and cat) repellant will result in its direct release to the environment. d-Limonene is present in a large number of plants and is given off as a volatile. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.98 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates d-limonene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase d-limonene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 156, 37 and 9 minutes, respectively. d-Limonene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, d-limonene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0281 atm-cu m/mole. d-Limonene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 73% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, d-limonene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 480 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to d-limonene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where d-limonene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to d-limonene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing d-limonene. d-Limonene is an active ingredient in several registered shampoo, dip and spray products applied to domestic animals to control fleas and ticks and human exposure to d-limonene can occur for the general population or veterinary and pet grooming professionals who use these products.

Vapor-phase d-limonene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone(SRC). The half-life for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals is estimated to be 2.6 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.71X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of d-limonene with ozone has been reported as 4.42X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(4); this corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 37 minutes at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(5). The calculated nighttime lifetime for the reaction of d-limonene with nitrate radicals is 9 minutes(6). d-Limonene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The NOES Survey does not include farm workers. Occupational exposure to d-limonene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where d-limonene is produced or used(SRC). d-Limonene was detected in air samples at a mean and median of 13 and 8.7 ug/cu m in schools and 16 and 7.5 ug/cu m in offices, respectively; samples were collected during summer and winter in and around Boston, MA, collection dates were not reported(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to d-limonene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing d-limonene(SRC). d-Limonene is an active ingredient in several registered shampoo, dip and spray products applied to domestic animals to control fleas and ticks and human exposure to d-limonene can occur for the general population or veterinary and pet grooming professionals who use these products(SRC).",
