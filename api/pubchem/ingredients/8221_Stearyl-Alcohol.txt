PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Intestinal radioactivity was determined in the intestinal homogenate which showed the percent absorbed radioactivity in the lymph was 56.6 +/- 14.0. Of this, more than half was found in the triglycerides of the lymph, 6 to 13 % in the phospholipids, 2 to 8% as the cholesterol esters, and 4 to 10% unchanged octadecanol. 90% of octadecanol was found in the lipomicrom fraction of the blood.

Wax esters and acyl moieties of glycerolipids contained most of the 14C-activity from 3 to 6 hr, because octadecanol was partly oxidized to stearate. Ether moieties were only weakly labeled. After 40 hr, 1-0-alkyl and 1-0-alk-1'-enyl diacylglycerols as well as 1-0-alkyl and 1-0-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamines contained nearly all of the radioactivity. Most of the label in the neutral ether lipids was located in the alkyl ether side chain, whereas, in the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction, most of the label was found in the alkenyl ether side chain.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.7X10-6 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates 1-octadecanol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-octadecanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 hours. Particulate-phase 1-octadecanol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, 1-octadecanol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.8X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. A percent theoretical oxygen demand value of 0.3 in 24 hrs using a Warburg test suggests that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 1-octadecanol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.8 hours and 7 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 140 days if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 2.8X10+4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since 1-octadecanol lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-octadecanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-octadecanol is produced or used. The general population can be exposed to 1-octadecanol through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact and use of household goods, pharmaceuticals, and toiletries containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its water solubility(2) and vapor pressure, 2.7X10-6 mm Hg(4), values. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.8 hours and 7 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 140 days if adsorption is considered (5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF value of 2.8X10+4(3), from its water solubility(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). A percent theoretical oxygen demand value of 0.3 in 24 hrs using a Warburg test(7) suggests that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
