                "Description": "Molecular weight or molecular mass refers to the mass of a molecule. It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",
