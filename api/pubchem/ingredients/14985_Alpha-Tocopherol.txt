The different types of tocopherol can be presented trimethylated, dimethylated or methylated in the positions 5-, 7- and 8-. When the carbons at position 5- and 7- are not methylated, they can function as electrophilic centers that can trap reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.

Vitamin E deficiency is seen in persons with abetalipoproteinemia, premature, very low birth weight infants (birth weights less than 1500 grams, or 3&frac12; pounds), cystic fibrosis, and cholestasis and severe liver disease. Preliminary research suggests vitamin E may help prevent or delay coronary heart disease and protect against the damaging effects of free radicals, which may contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer. It also protects other fat-soluble vitamins (A and B group vitamins) from destruction by oxygen. Low levels of vitamin E have been linked to increased incidence of breast and colon cancer.",

This treatment resulted in three to fourfold differences in the retinal alpha-tocopherol levels of the pups. The combination of dietary and oxygen treatments also resulted in significant differences in retinal glutathione peroxidase activity, with the vitamin E deprived, oxygen exposed group having highest levels.

More deeply, the metabolism of tocopherol begins with the hepatic metabolism which is led by a CYP4F2/CYP3A4-dependent ω-hydroxylation of the side chains which leads to the formation of 13'-carboxychromanol. The metabolic pathway is followed by five cycles of β-oxidation. The β-oxidation cycles function by shortening the side chains, the first cycle results in the formation of carboxydimethyldecylhydroxychromanol followed by carboxymethyloctylhydroxychromanol. These two metabolites are categorized as long-chain metabolites and they are not excreted in the urine. Some intermediate-chain metabolites that are products of two rounds of β-oxidation are carboxymethylhexylhydroxychromanol and carboxymethylbutylhydroxychromanol. These intermediate-chain metabolites can be found in human feces and urine. The catabolic end-product of tocopherols, as stated before, is CEHC which can be largely found in urine and feces.  Two new metabolites have been detected in human and mice feces. These new metabolites are 12'-hydroxychromanol and 11'-hydroxychromanol. Because of their chemistry, it is thought that these metabolites can be the evidence for a ω-1 and ω-2 hydroxylation which leads to an impaired oxidation of 12'-OH followed side-chain truncation.",

Alpha-tocopherol exhibits anti-oxidative capacity in vitro, and inhibits oxidation of ldl. Beside this, alpha-tocopherol shows anti-inflammatory activity and modulates expression of proteins involved in uptake, transport and degradation of tocopherols, as well as the uptake, storage and export of lipids such as cholesterol. Despite promising anti-atherogenic features in vitro, vitamin E failed to be atheroprotective in clinical trials in humans. Recent studies highlight the importance of long-chain metabolites of alpha-tocopherol, which are formed as catabolic intermediate products in the liver and occur in human plasma. These metabolites modulate inflammatory processes and macrophage foam cell formation via mechanisms different than that of their metabolic precursor alpha-tocopherol and at lower concentrations. Here we summarize the controversial role of vitamin E as a preventive agent against atherosclerosis and point the attention to recent findings that highlight a role of these long-chain metabolites of vitamin E as a proposed new class of regulatory metabolites. We speculate that the metabolites contribute to physiological as well as pathophysiological processes.",

Younger (mean +/- SD age: 32 +/- 7 y; n = 12 women and 9 men) and older (aged 67 +/- 8 y; n = 8 women and 12 men) adults consumed a test breakfast that included 120 g (2)H collard greens (1.2 +/- 0.1 mg (2)H-alpha-tocopherol). Plasma unlabeled alpha-tocopherol and (2)H-alpha-tocopherol were measured by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry from fasting (>12 hr) blood samples drawn before breakfast (0 hr) and at 24, 48, and 72 hr and from postprandial samples collected at 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, and 16 hr.

Unlabeled alpha-tocopherol concentrations were higher in older adults (26.4 +/- 8.6 umol/L) than in younger adults (19.3 +/- 4.2 umol/L; P = 0.0019) and correlated with serum lipids (r = 0.4938, P = 0.0012). In addition, (2)H-alpha-tocopherol half-lives were correlated with lipids (r = 0.4361, P = 0.0044). Paradoxically, alpha-tocopherol remained in circulation longer in participants with higher serum lipids, but the (2)H-alpha-tocopherol absorbed was not dependent on the plasma lipid status. Neither variable was dependent on age. These data suggest that plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations are more dependent on mechanisms that control circulating lipids rather than those related to its absorption and initial incorporation into plasma.",

NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) provides a mechanistic link between inflammation and cancer, and is a major factor controlling the ability of malignant cells to resist tumor surveillance mechanisms. NF-kappaB might also regulate tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness and the signalling pathways that mediate its activation provide attractive targets for new chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic approaches. ROS (reactive oxygen species) initiate inflammation by up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore antioxidants provide a major defence against inflammation. alpha-Tocopherol is a lipid-soluble antioxidant. In addition to decreasing lipid peroxidation, alpha-tocopherol may exert intracellular effects. Hence, the aim of this study was to test the effect of alpha-tocopherol supplementation in cancer prevention via suppression of NF-kappaB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines. alpha-Tocopherol treatment significantly down-regulates expression, synthesis as well as secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (interleukin-6) in cancerous mice. It also suppresses NF-kappaB binding to IL-6 promoter in liver leading to decreased secretion of IL-6 in serum. The regulation of the signalling pathway by alpha-tocopherol is found apart from its antioxidant capacity to reduce lipid peroxidation. Thus, the present study provides evidence for the hypothesis that besides the powerful free radical scavenging effects, alpha-tocopherol has genomic effects in down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and cancer prevention via the NF-kappaB-dependent pathway.",

However, the molecular events by which ROS production leads to apoptosis has not been clearly defined. In this study with the mitocan alpha-tocopheryl succinate (alpha-TOS) the role of the Bcl-2 family proteins in the mechanism of malignant cell apoptosis has been determined. Exposure of several different cancer cell lines to alpha-TOS increased expression of the Noxa protein, but none of the other proteins of the Bcl-2 family, an event that was independent of the cellular p53 status. alpha-TOS caused a profound conformational change in the pro-apoptotic protein, Bak, involving oligomerization in all cell types, and this also applied to the Bax protein, but only in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that alpha-TOS activates the two BH1-3 proteins, Bak or Bax, to form high molecular weight complexes in the mitochondria. RNAi knockdown revealed that Noxa and Bak are required for alpha-TOS-induced apoptosis, and the role of Bak was confirmed using Bak- and/or Bax-deficient cells. We conclude that the major events induced by alpha-TOS in cancer cells downstream of ROS production leading to mitochondrial apoptosis involve the Noxa-Bak axis. It is proposed that this represents a common mechanism for mitochondrial destabilization activated by a variety of mitocans that induce accumulation of ROS in the early phases of apoptosis. /alpha-Tocopheryl succinate/",

Lewis and Bronsted acids, especially zinc chloride with a mineral acid, serve as catalysts for condensation. Boron trifluoride and AlCl3, Fe/HCl, trifluoracetic acid, and boric acid/carboxylic acid are also good catalysts. A wide range of solvents can be used, e.g., ethyl acetate, acetic acid, (chlorinated) hydrocarbons or supercritical CO2. When synthetic phytol or isophytol is used, the product consists of equal amounts of all eight alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers and is thus denominated (all-rac)-alpha-tocopherol. The majority of synthetic alpha-tocopherol is treated with acetic anhydride to give the acetate, which is stable on storage. In addition, the succinate (monoester of succinic acid) and the nicotinate are produced commercially. Purification of the crude product is possible at the free tocopherol or acetate stage by short-path distillation under high vacuum or extraction with supercritical CO2.",

The principal synthesis in current commercial use involves condensation of 2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone with synthetic isophytol in an inert solvent, such as benzene or hexane, with an acid catalyst, such as zinc chloride, boron trifluoride, or orthoboric acid/oxalic acid to give the all-rac-a-tocopherol. Free tocopherol is protected as its acetate ester by reaction with acetic anhydride. Purification of tocopheryl acetate is readily accomplished by high vacuum molecular distillation and rectification (equation image) to achieve the required USP standard.",

Alternatively, they can be eliminated by distillation, preferably after esterification. The sterols can be separated by treatment with hydrogen chloride or CaCl2, by crystallization, or by extraction. Alternatively, the free sterols can be esterified with the excess fatty acids, and the tocopherols can be separated from the high-boiling sterol fatty acid esters by distillation. After removal of the free fatty acids, the tocopherols can be concentrated by adsorption on basic ion exchangers.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Vitamin E is pale yellow viscous oil. Previously, the term vitamin E was used as the generic term for four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta), that are organic compounds which possess antioxidant activity to a different degree. Factors have been used to convert food contents of tocopherols and tocotrienols to alpha-tocopherol equivalents. Recent literature considers vitamin E as being d-alpha-tocopherol only. Vitamin E is used as antioxidant for fats; animal feed additive. It is also used as human and animal medication and dietary supplement. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Clinical studies indicate that, generally, intakes of below about 720 mg/day are without adverse effects in man, but one investigation in elderly patients showed an increase in serum cholesterol at doses of 300 mg alpha-tocopherol daily. Clinical deficiency of vitamin E is rare because adequate amounts are supplied in the normal diet. Symptoms of deficiency include ataxia, muscle weakness, nystagmus, and losses in touch and pain sensations. Vitamin E deficiency in premature infants may result in hemolytic anemia, thrombocytosis, and increased platelet aggregation. Incidences of allergic reactions seem to be very rare. Vitamin E appears to have no effect on all-cause mortality at doses up to 5,500 IU/d. Epidemiological studies have associated higher vitamin E status with reduced cancer risk. However, a recent cancer prevention trial found that dietary supplementation with vitamin E significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer among healthy men. Epidemiological studies found significant inverse associations between serum concentrations of vitamin E and adiposity among children. alpha-Tocopherol could improve teratozoospermia motility and viability. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rats were reported to tolerate doses of 4 g/kg daily for two months, and mice tolerated oral doses of 50 g/kg daily for two months. However, recent study indicates that pharmacological dose of alpha-tocopherol supplementation can induce cardiotoxicity in healthy rats. In rats vitamin E depressed body-weight gain at concentrations of 10,000 and 25,000 IU/kg diet, and increased relative heart and spleen weights were seen at 8 months and 16 months, respectively. In developmental studies vitamin E was administered in amounts of 150 or 300 mg/kg/day to pregnant mice sc on days 6, 8 and 10 of gestation. Growth retardation and fetal survival were increased in the treated group. The incidence of cleft palate was increased. Developmental studies with rat (75 mg/day) were negative. Developmental neurotoxicity has been described in several studies in rats following maternal supplementation with vitamin E.  alpha-Tocopherol was non-carcinogenic. Mice treated with carcinogenic doses of dibenzanthrene had a higher incidence of lung tumors when given 2 mg alpha-tocopherol every 2 days than when fed a vitamin E-deficient diet; subcutaneous tumors were also more common. Conversely, in more recent studies, vitamin E has been found to reduce skin tumor incidence induced by 7,12-dimethylbenzanthrene. In rats when the vitamin E diet with selenium supplementation was applied until three weeks after 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or until the termination of the experiment, tumor yields (tumors per rat) were significantly inhibited compared with the control group. The mutagenic activity of nitric oxide was effectively inhibited by tocopherols.",

                          "String": "Although all forms of Vitamin E exhibit antioxidant activity, it is known that the antioxidant activity of vitamin E is not sufficient to explain the vitamin's biological activity. <br/>Vitamin E's anti-atherogenic activity involves the inhibition of the oxidation of LDL and the accumulation of oxLDL in the arterial wall. It also appears to reduce oxLDL-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Oxidation of LDL is a key early step in atherogenesis as it triggers a number of events which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) activity. PKC plays a role in smooth muscle cell proliferation, and, thus, the inhibition of PKC results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is involved in atherogenesis. <br/>Vitamin E's antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities involves the downregulation of the expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule(ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM)-1 which lowers the adhesion of blood components to the endothelium. In addition, vitamin E upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 which in turn enhances the release of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a vasodilating factor and inhibitor of platelet aggregation and platelet release. It is also known that platelet aggregation is mediated by a mechanism involving the binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complex of platelets. GPIIb/IIIa is the major membrane receptor protein that is key to the role of the platelet aggregation response. GPIIb is the alpha-subunit of this platelet membrane protein. Alpha-tocopherol downregulates GPIIb promoter activity which results in reduction of GPIIb protein expression and decreased platelet aggregation. Vitamin E has also been found in culture to decrease plasma production of thrombin, a protein which binds to platelets and induces aggregation. A metabolite of vitamin E called vitamin E quinone or alpha-tocopheryl quinone (TQ) is a potent anticoagulant. This metabolite inhibits vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which is a major enzyme in the coagulation cascade.<br/>The neuroprotective effects of vitamin E are explained by its antioxidant effects. Many disorders of the nervous system are caused by oxidative stress. Vitamin E protects against this stress, thereby protecting the nervouse system. <br/>The immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin E have been demonstrated in vitro, where alpha-tocopherol increases mitogenic response of T lymphocytes from aged mice. The mechanism of this response by vitamin E is not well understood, however it has been suggested that vitamin E itself may have mitogenic activity independent of its antioxidant activity. <br/>Lastly, the mechanism of action of vitamin E's antiviral effects (primarily against HIV-1) involves its antioxidant activity. Vitamin E reduces oxidative stress, which is thought to contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, as well as to the pathogenesis of other viral infections. Vitamin E also affects membrane integrity and fluidity and, since HIV-1 is a membraned virus, altering membrane fluidity of HIV-1 may interfere with its ability to bind to cell-receptor sites, thus decreasing its infectivity.",

These thermodynamic properties can be used to predict a pecking order, or hierarchy, for free radical reactions. Using one-electron reduction potentials, the predicted pecking order is in agreement with experimentally observed free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions. These potentials are also in agreement with experimental data that suggest that vitamin E, the primary lipid soluble small molecule antioxidant, and vitamin C, the terminal water soluble small molecule antioxidant, cooperate to protect lipids and lipid structures against peroxidation. Although vitamin E is located in membranes and vitamin C is located in aqueous phases, vitamin C is able to recycle vitamin E; i.e., vitamin C repairs the tocopheroxyl (chromanoxyl) radical of vitamin E, thereby permitting vitamin E to function again as a free radical chain-breaking antioxidant. This review discusses: (i) the thermodynamics of free radical reactions that are of interest to the health sciences; (ii) the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties that are associated with chain-breaking antioxidants; (iii) the unique interfacial nature of the apparent reaction of the tocopherol free radical (vitamin E radical) and vitamin C; and (iv) presents a hierarchy, or pecking order, for free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions.",

The effects of ascorbic acid supplementation on the tissue antioxidant status seem to be dependent on the dose of ascorbic acid and the vitamin E status. Adequate doses of ascorbic acid supplementation to vitamin E-deficient subjects or animals help to partially maintain vitamin E levels, probably through sparing the degradative metabolism of vitamin E, and thus increase the antioxidant effectiveness. The sparing effect of ascorbic acid on vitamin E metabolism is also shown in the partial reversal of the manifestation of vitamin E deficiency. On the other hand, when the animals are marginally adequate in vitamin E status, ascorbic acid supplementation in large doses appears to promote lipid peroxidation and significantly decreases the antioxidant potential of animals. An increase of the level of vitamin E supplementation overcomes the prooxidant effect of large doses of ascorbic acid. This observation suggests that vitamin E requirement may be increased with a large dose of ascorbic acid supplementation.",

Zidovudine caused dose-dependent toxicity to the fetus upon administration via drinking water to pregnant mice from days 1 to 13 of gestation. At the 0.5 mg/ml dose level, zidovudine caused a decrease in the number of fetuses to 12 from an average of 16.5 in control animals, and the fetal size (crown-rump length) was reduced from 10.5 to 8.5 mm. The CFU of the erythroid progenitor cell colonies derived from the fetal hepatic cells were decreased to 38% of that of the control, and the hematocrit dropped to 33.5 + or - 1.7 from a control value of 42.6 + or - 2.5. Concomitant administration of erythropoietin, vitamin E, or interleukin-3 to the zidovudine treated pregnant mice caused a significant reversal in the zidovudine induced toxicity to the fetu and to the mother's bone marrow. The success of therapeutic intervention was demonstrated by restoration of the number of fetuses to the level of untreated controls, an increase in the size of fetuses to normal values, and an increase i hematocrit to > 40.",

Dietary antioxidants can influence BP, but their effects on variability are yet to be investigated. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of vitamin E, vitamin C and polyphenols on the rate of daytime and night-time ambulatory BP variation. To assess these effects, two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were performed. In the first trial (vitamin E), fifty-eight individuals with type 2 diabetes were given 500 mg/d of RRR-alpha-tocopherol, 500 mg/d of mixed tocopherols or placebo for 6 weeks. In the second trial (vitamin C-polyphenols), sixty-nine treated hypertensive individuals were given 500 mg/d of vitamin C, 1000 mg/d of grape-seed polyphenols, both vitamin C and polyphenols, or neither (placebo) for 6 weeks. At baseline and at the end of the 6-week intervention, 24 hr ambulatory BP and rate of measurement-to-measurement BP variation were assessed. Compared with placebo, treatment with alpha-tocopherol, mixed tocopherols, vitamin C and polyphenols did not significantly alter the rate of daytime or night-time systolic BP, diastolic BP or pulse pressure variation (P>0.05). Treatment with the vitamin C and polyphenol combination resulted in higher BP variation: the rate of night-time systolic BP variation (P= 0.022) and pulse pressure variation (P= 0.0036) were higher and the rate of daytime systolic BP variation was higher (P= 0.056). Vitamin E, vitamin C or grape-seed polyphenols did not significantly alter the rate of BP variation. However, the increase in the rate of BP variation suggests that the combination of high doses of vitamin C and polyphenols could be detrimental to treated hypertensive individuals.",

The antiproliferative effects of alpha-tocopherol have been previously demonstrated. In this study the antimutagenic effects of vitamin E on oncology and non oncology hospital nurses was investigated. A total of 138 female nurses from oncology and non oncology hospitals participated in the study. They received 200 mg/day vitamin E for 2 weeks. The urine samples before and after intake of vitamin E were collected and the nucleus of urothelial cells were evaluated with comet assay. The length of epithelial cells nuclei correlated with increased fracture rate of DNA. Nucleolus length of urine epithelial cells of all nursing staff before and after vitamin E treatment were measured and the data were evaluated by student t-test and SPSS. Our study showed that 20% of nursing staff have apoptosis and DNA fracture in the nucleolus of their urine epithelial cells and DNA damage in the urothelial cells of exposed nurses was significantly higher than the control group (P<0.05). The antimutagenic activity of vitamin E had significant effects on oncology hospital nurses effectively in repairing DNA damage and decreasing their nucleus length in urine epithelial cells. We propose that the higher therapeutic doses of vitamin E and increasing the length of treatment period will be effective against DNA strand breakage and may have more effect on oncology nurses.",

No study to our knowledge, however, has examined the association between genetic variants and response to long-term vitamin E supplementation. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of common variants associated with circulating alpha-tocopherol concentrations following 3 y of controlled supplementation. The study population included 2112 middle-aged, male smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort who received a trial supplementation of alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/d) and had fasting serum alpha-tocopherol concentrations measured after 3 years. Serum concentrations were log-transformed for statistical analysis and general linear models adjusted for age, BMI, serum total cholesterol, and cancer case status. Associations with serum response to alpha-tocopherol supplementation achieved genome-wide significance for 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP): rs964184 on 11q23.3 (P = 2.6 x 10(-12)) and rs2108622 on 19pter-p13.11 (P = 2.2 x 10(-7)), and approached genome-wide significance for one SNP, rs7834588 on 8q12.3 (P = 6.2 x 10(-7)). Combined, these SNP explain 3.4% of the residual variance in serum alpha-tocopherol concentrations during controlled vitamin E supplementation. A GWAS has identified 3 genetic variants at different loci that appear associated with serum concentrations after vitamin E supplementation in men. Identifying genetic variants that influence serum nutrient biochemical status (e.g., alpha-tocopherol) under supplementation conditions improves our understanding of the biological determinants of these nutritional exposures and their associations with cancer etiology.",

All randomized, controlled trials testing the treatment effect of vitamin E supplementation in adults for at least one year were sought. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and Biological Abstracts databases were searched using the terms \"vitamin E,\" \"alpha-tocopherol,\" \"antioxidants,\" \"clinical trial,\" and \"controlled trial\" for studies published through April 2010; results were limited to English, German, or Spanish language articles. Studies were also obtained through reference mining. All randomized controlled trials using vitamin E, with a supplementation period of at least one year, to prevent or treat disease in adults were identified and abstracted independently by two raters. Mortality data from trials with a supplementation period of at least one year were pooled. The selected trials (n = 57) were published between 1988 and 2009. Sample sizes range from 28 to 39,876 (median = 423), yielding 246,371 subjects and 29,295 all-cause deaths. Duration of supplementation for the 57 trials range from one to 10.1 years (median = 2.6 years). A random effects meta-analysis produce an overall risk ratio of 1.00 (95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.02); additional analyses suggest no relationship between dose and risk of mortality. Based on the present meta-analysis, supplementation with vitamin E appears to have no effect on all-cause mortality at doses up to 5,500 IU/d.",

Animals were randomly assigned to either C (control, n = 11) or E (alpha-tocopherol, n = 11) group. Animals received corn oil (C) or alpha-tocopherol dissolved in corn oil (250 mg alpha-tocopherol/[kg body wt/day]) (E) by gavage for a 7-week period. Rats underwent echocardiogram and were analyzed for cardiomyocyte histology and cardiac alpha-tocopherol absorption at the end of the study period. As compared to the C group, alpha-tocopherol-supplemented group showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower body weight (E, 412.8 g vs C, 480.3 g) and total cardiac weight (E, 0.94 g vs C, 1.08 g); cardiomyocyte histological impairment; smaller left ventricle (LV) (LV end-diastolic diameter (E, 7.22 mm vs C, 7.37 mm), lower LV systolic [left ventricle fractional shortening (E, 47.6% vs C, 53.6%) and ejection fraction ratio (E, 85.4 vs C, 89.9)] and diastolic [early peak velocities of diastolic transmitral flow (E, 64.6 cm/sec vs C, 75.1 cm/sec)] function. The alpha-tocopherol uptake in target tissue was confirmed by determination of alpha-tocopherol concentration medians in cardiac tissue (E, 109.91 nmol/kg vs C, 52.09 nmol/kg). The current study indicates that pharmacological dose of alpha-tocopherol supplementation can induce cardiotoxicity in healthy rats.",

Vitamin E occurs in wide variety of plants including green vegetables, grains and plant oils. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.4X10-8 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates vitamin E will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase vitamin E will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.7 hours. Particulate-phase vitamin E will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Vitamin E absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, vitamin E is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.5X10+7. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Vitamin E is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Vitamin was biodegraded by aerobic bacterial communities isolated from marine sediment. However, biodegradation data relevant to environmental importance in soil and water were not available. If released into water, vitamin E is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 29 hours and 15 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 39 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to vitamin E may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where vitamin E is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to vitamin E via ingestion of food and food supplements, and dermal contact with consumer products containing vitamin E.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

However, factors such as maternal nutritional status and nutrient interaction may limit its bioavailability. The aim of this study was to establish nutritional status for vitamins A and E and evaluate the correlation of retinol on colostrum alpha-tocopherol in lactating women. A total of 103 lactating women were recruited at a Brazilian public maternity hospital. Fasting serum and colostrum samples were collected in the immediate post-partum. Retinol and alpha-tocopherol levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and nutritional status for these vitamins was defined from specific cut-off points for serum and colostrum. Mean serum and colostrum retinol (1.49 umol L(-1) , 2.18 umol L(-1)) and alpha-tocopherol (26.4 umol L(-1) , 26.1 umol L(-1)) indicated satisfactory biochemical status. However, we found a prevalence of subclinical deficiency of vitamin A and vitamin E in serum (15.5% and 16%) and colostrum (50% and 60%). Lactating women with serum retinol <1.05 umol L(-1) showed an inverse correlation between serum retinol andalpha-tocopherol concentration in the colostrum (P = 0.008, r = -0.28). This association was not observed in serum level < 1.05 umol L(-1) . The nutritional status of lactating women for vitamins A and E was adequate, although there is a risk of subclinical deficiency. The negative correlation of serum retinol on alpha-tocopherol concentration in the colostrum must be carefully evaluated in situations of vitamin A supplementation, because alpha-tocopherol bioavailability in maternal milk may be compromised.",

These vitamins share routes of transport to the tissues and antagonistic effects have been observed in animals after supplementation with vitamin A. The present study aimed to determine the effect of maternal supplementation with a megadose of retinyl palmitate in the immediate post-partum on alpha-tocopherol concentration in the colostrum. Healthy parturient women at a Brazilian public maternity were recruited for the study and divided into two groups: control (n = 37) and supplemented (n = 36). Blood and colostrum samples were collected up to 16 hr post-partum. The supplemented group was administered with a retinyl palmitate capsule and, 24 hr after the first collection, the second colostrum sample was obtained in the two groups for analysis of alpha-tocopherol. The cut-off points for deficiency are <1.05 umol L(-1) for retinol and <11.6 umol L(-1) for alpha-tocopherol. The mean (SD) serum concentration of 1.77 (0.50) umol L(-1) for retinol and 30.81 (6.46) umol L(-1) for alpha-tocopherolindicates an adequate biochemical status. The supplemented group showed an increase of alpha-tocopherol in the colostrum 24hr after supplementation (P = 0.04), and this finding was not observed in the control group. Supplementation with a 200,000 IU megadose of vitamin A did not negatively affect alpha-tocopherol levels in colostrum",
