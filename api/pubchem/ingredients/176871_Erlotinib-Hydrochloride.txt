Many indications are label indications, approved by a regulatory agency (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or European Medical Agency), meaning that the manufacturer is allowed to market the drug for the approved indications.  However, some indications are not approved, and therefore, they are called off-label indications.  This section may include both label indications and off-label indications.",

In patients with tumours without EGFR activating mutations, Tarceva is indicated when other treatment options are not considered suitable.
