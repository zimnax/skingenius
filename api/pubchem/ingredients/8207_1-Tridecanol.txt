PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.36X10-4 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates 1-tridecanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-tridecanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours. If released to soil, 1-tridecanol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 35,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. The biodegradation half-life of 1-tridecanol is calculated as 5.6 days, using a degradation rate of 5.2X10-3 1/hr. If released into water, 1-tridecanol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation studies with activated sludge suggest that 1-tridecanol will biodegrade quickly in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 14 hours and 8.5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 16 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 600 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-tridecanol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-tridecanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-tridecanol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing 1-tridecanol.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
